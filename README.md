# Stupidly simple, light replacement for GNU autotools

Using GNU autotools is not fun, but we still need a roughly similar tool.

## Problems of GNU autotools

* Even in the early days, running the configure generated by GNU
  autotools was slow. And it is still slow.

* The configure is slow, because it is checking things that was useful
  to check in the age before POSIX standardization, for example. But
  this is not essential anymore. So, we can make it simpler.

* Why to use a separate configuration language where a simple
  POSIX-compliant shell script will do?

## Why not to simply create the configure script manually?

* There is a certain amount of reusable code that is useful to copy from
  project to project. We don't wish to maintain all that in every
  project's version control. Version control should have only the pieces
  that are unique to that particular project.
